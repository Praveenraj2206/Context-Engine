# Word Suggestion Implementation

A Python-based **word suggestion system** that provides relevant word suggestions based on a given input. It uses **string similarity and frequency-based logic** to find meaningful suggestions from a text corpus.

## Features

- Suggests closest or most relevant words for a given input  
- Handles misspellings and incomplete words  
- Lightweight and does not require heavy ML models  

## Used Technologies

- **NumPy** – efficient numerical operations  
- **Pandas** – structured text data handling  
- **textdistance** – calculates similarity between words  
- **Python built-in modules** (`re`, `collections`) – text cleaning and word frequency counting  

## Applications

- Search box auto-suggestions  
- Spell-check or typo correction systems  
- Text preprocessing pipelines  
- NLP applications requiring approximate word matching  
- Educational or research projects in text analysis  

## Benefits

- Improves user experience in text-based applications  
- Simple, interpretable approach to word suggestion  
- Easy to integrate and run without heavy dependencies
