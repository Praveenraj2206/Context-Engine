    "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and cyanobacteria convert light energy into chemical energy using chlorophyll. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water are transformed into glucose and oxygen through a series of light-dependent and light-independent reactions. Cellular respiration is a complementary process that occurs in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells, where glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen to produce ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell. DNA replication is a fundamental biological process that ensures genetic information is accurately copied before cell division, relying on enzymes such as DNA polymerase and helicase. Mutations in DNA can occur due to errors in replication or exposure to environmental factors like radiation, and while many mutations are neutral, some can lead to genetic disorders or evolutionary advantages. The theory of evolution by natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin, explains how heritable traits that improve survival and reproduction become more common in populations over generations. In human physiology, the nervous system transmits electrical and chemical signals to coordinate movement, sensation, and cognition. The immune system protects organisms from pathogens through innate defenses such as skin barriers and adaptive responses involving antibodies and specialized white blood cells.\n",
